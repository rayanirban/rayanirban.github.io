**Deep Learning for Industrial and Microscopy Image Analysis (2018–2021)**  

From 2018 to 2021, my research at [Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/){target="_blank" .flj} focused on developing deep learning–based systems for high-precision image understanding in biomedical microscopy. I worked on combining computer vision and AI-driven automation for identifying and quantifying objects of interest in complex visual data.

**Publications:**

- [*Quantitative Analysis System for Bacterial Cells in SEM Images Using Deep Learning*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9400322){target="_blank" .flj} (*CISS 2021*) — introduced a neural architecture for accurate segmentation and counting of bacterial cells from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data.
- [*Deep Learning Based Bacteria Classification from SEM Images Using a Combination of Membrane and Internal Features*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9751170){target="_blank" .flj} (*CISS 2022*) — improved bacterial classification by jointly modeling morphological and internal structural cues.

**Patents:**

- [US Patent 12327363](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12327363B2){target="_blank" .flj} — methods and apparatuses for generating neural models that identify and segment objects of interest from images.
- [US Patent 12211213](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12211213B2){target="_blank" .flj} — adaptive feature extraction and object detection for microscopy imaging.
- [EP Patent 3961562A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP3961562A1){target="_blank" .flj} — AI image-processing systems for industrial and microscopy applications.

This phase of my work established a foundation in AI-driven visual understanding, bridging industrial automation with quantitative biological imaging, and set the stage for my later research in generative and flow-based models for microscopy restoration.

**<span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Modeling the Feature Evolution in CNNs using LSTM</span>**  
![](images/masters.png){fig-align="center" width="80%" alt="Modeling the Feature Evolution in CNNs using LSTM"}

During my master's studies at [Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://www.nitech.ac.jp/eng/){target="_blank" .flj}, Japan (2018), I explored the temporal dynamics of feature representations in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. My research focused on understanding how features evolve across layers in CNNs and leveraging LSTMs to model these transitions for improved image classification performance.
